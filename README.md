MopaBootstrapBundle
===================

MopaBootstrapBundle is a collection of code to integrate twitter's bootstrap
(http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) as easy as possible into your symfony2
(http://www.symfony.com) Project.

**NEW:**  
To make your base HTML5 even better and let you use good practices we added  
to this bundle features from [HTML5 BoilerPlate Project](http://html5boilerplate.com/).  
Integration was done using setup pregenerated with support of [Initializr](http://www.initializr.com/).  
Actually we support __HTML5__ __BoilerPlate__ _v3.0.3_ with __Modernizr__ _v2.5.3_ and __Respond__.

To learn how to use this features read [Initializr docs (50-Initializr.md)](Resources/docs/initializr.md).  
This implementation is maintained by [Pawel Madej (nysander)](http://github.com/nysander)
